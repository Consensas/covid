        <h2>When to seek help</h2>
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>Symptoms of novel coronavirus include fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia.</p>
        <p>The severity can range from mild to severe, and in some cases, infection can lead to death. Current information suggests most people don’t experience severe illness or need to be hospitalized.</p>
        <h3>What to do if you think you might have come in contact with COVID-19</h3>
        <p>If you’ve travelled outside Canada, you may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus. You should closely monitor your health for 14 days after you get back to Canada.</p>
        <p>If you’ve travelled recently and you start to feel unwell, you should self isolate. This means you should stay home, away from the public. </p>
        <p>If you develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, or a cough, you should call 811 for assessment.</p>
        <p>Nova Scotia Health Authority has established <a href="http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus" data-analytics="label=COVID-19 assessment centres">COVID-19 assessment centres</a>. If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.</p>
        <p>If you’ve been directed to self-isolate, you can get information from Nova Scotia Health Authority Public Health by <a href="http://www.nshealth.ca/public-health-offices" data-analytics="label=Public Health offices">contacting the nearest office</a>.</p>
        <h3>If you self-isolate or feel unwell</h3>
        <p>Avoid close contact with people with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and older adults.</p>
        <p>Don’t have visitors to your home.</p>
        <p>Avoid situations like social gatherings, work, school, daycare, or visiting other people who are in a health care facility or long-term care residence.</p>
        <p>Limit taking public transit, taxis and ride sharing.</p>
        <p>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water, for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.</p>
        <p>Cover your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing.</p>

        <h2>Protecting yourself from coronavirus</h2>
        <p>There are currently no vaccines available to protect you against the novel coronavirus. Nova Scotians are encouraged to think about what they can do to stay healthy and prevent the spread of any respiratory illness, including COVID-19.</p>
        <p>There are <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-be-prepared-infographic.html" data-analytics="COVID-19 infographic">simple, practical things you can do to prepare</a> in case you or someone in your household becomes ill or if COVID-19 becomes common in your community.</p>
        <h3>Advice for individuals and families</h3>
        <h4>Practise good hand hygiene</h4>
        <p>Wash or sanitize hands often, particularly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>before and after preparing or eating food</li>
          <li>after touching pets</li>
          <li>after handling waste, dirty laundry or bathroom use</li>
          <li>whenever hands look dirty</li>
          <li>after shaking hands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Washing with soap and water is preferred – rubbing hands together removes visible dirt and germs. Use disposable paper towels (preferred) for drying hands, or a reusable towel that is laundered often.</p>
        <p>If soap and water aren’t available (and your hands aren’t visibly dirty), use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Use enough to cover the fronts and backs of both hands and between all fingers. Rub hands together until they feel dry.</p>
        <h4>Use cough and sneeze etiquette</h4>
        <p>Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue.  Dispose used tissues in the garbage and wash your hands, or use an alcohol-based hand rub immediately after.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have a tissue, cough and sneeze into your elbow, not your hand.</p>
        <p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>
        <h4>Clean high-touch surfaces and objects often </h4>
        <p>Viruses can live on surfaces for several days. Frequent cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces and objects can reduce germs and prevent infection. You should clean at least once a day, or more if needed.</p>
        <p>Clean and disinfect items like doorknobs, light switches, railings, toilets and tabletops daily. Wash with soapy water first. Then disinfect using household cleaning products, following the directions on the label, or a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water.</p>
        <p>Disinfect phones, remote controls, computers and other handheld devices with 70% alcohol or wipes.</p>
        <p>Wash or launder clothing, sheets and towels on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>Dispose of garbage on a regular basis. Wash hands after.</p>
        <h4>Make a plan</h4>
        <p>Being prepared is good advice any time.</p>
        <p>All Nova Scotians should have an emergency kit and basic supplies that you/your family may need for up to 72 hours. Don’t panic buy or stockpile.</p>
        <p>Make sure your prescriptions are filled.</p>
        <p>Think about what you’ll do if you or member of your family becomes sick and needs care.</p>
        <p>Talk to your employer about working from home if you need to self-isolate or care for a family member who is ill.</p>
        <p>Communicate with family and friends. Let them know you’re making a plan. Share yours with them. Check in on each other and run essential errand should one of you become ill.</p>
        <p>If you become ill, stay home until you are no longer showing symptoms.</p>
        <h4>Mental well-being</h4>
        <p>A new virus like COVID-19 can create fear and anxiety. The best ways to address concerns and support each other include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>listen and provide reassurance – it's normal to have questions</li>
          <li>get information from reliable sources</li>
          <li>address questions and correct misinformation</li>
          <li>watch for discrimination or bullying related to COVID-19</li>
          <li>maintain normal routines and programming as much as possible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For help with mental health concerns, call 811 or the Mental Health Crisis Line toll-free at 1-888-429-8167.</p>
        <h4>Advice for employers and community groups</h4>
        <p>Employers should think about what they can do to help staff stay healthy and prevent spread of any respiratory illness, including COVID-19.</p>
        <p>As well as following the advice for individuals, businesses and community groups should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>make sure you have a business continuity or emergency plan in place</li>
          <li>think about what you’ll do if several of your employees get sick</li>
          <li>support employees who get sick – talk to your staff about flexible hours or alternative work options if they need to stay at home for an extended period</li>
          <li>post handwashing signs and provide alcohol-based hand rub to encourage frequent hand hygiene</li>
          <li>make sure spaces and surfaces are cleaned</li>
          <li>don’t request doctors’ notes from employees who get sick or self-isolate</li>
          <li>remove non-essential items like magazines, stuffed toys, and other items that can’t be easily cleaned from reception areas</li>
        </ul>
