    In recent years there has been an increasing demand for relevant health information at a 'community' level. As a result, health regions have become an important geographic unit by which health and health-related data are produced.

    Health regions are legislated administrative areas defined by provincial ministries of health. These administrative areas represent geographic areas of responsibility for hospital boards or regional health authorities. Health regions, being provincial administrative areas, are subject to change.

    The 2014 Health Regions: Boundaries and Correspondence with Census Geography reflects the boundaries as of December 2014 and provides the geographic linkage to 2011 and 2006 Censuses.
