merged data - this is the primary dataset.
Things are broken out by country, except
for Canada, US and Australia, which are by
state/province.

At the moment this dataset is primarily 
Canada focused, but all the names of everything
else are nicely normalized at least.

run `cook.js` to merge

merged datasets are specified in `cook.yaml`
