Aggregate dissemination area (ADA)
The aggregate dissemination area (ADA) is a new dissemination geography created for the 2016 Census. ADAs cover the entire country and, where possible, have a population between 5,000 and 15,000 based on the previous census population counts. ADAs are created from existing dissemination geographic areas and are formed from census tracts (CTs), census subdivisions (CSDs) or dissemination areas (DAs). ADAs respect provincial, territorial, census division (CD), census metropolitan area (CMA) and census agglomeration (CA) with census tract (CT) boundaries.

The intent of the ADA geography is to ensure the availability of census data, where possible, across all regions of Canada.


Census metropolitan influenced zones (MIZ)  
The census metropolitan influenced zone (MIZ) is a concept that geographically differentiates the area of Canada outside census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs). Census subdivisions (CSDs) within provinces that are outside CMAs and CAs are assigned to one of four categories according to the degree of influence (strong, moderate, weak or no influence) that the CMAs or CAs have on them. CSDs within the territories that are outside CAs are assigned to a separate category.

A municipality within a province is assigned to a census metropolitan influenced zone (MIZ) category depending on the percentage of its resident employed labour force that commute to work in one or more of the municipalities (census subdivisions) that are part of the delineation core of a CMA or CA. The calculation of the resident employed labour force excludes the category of no fixed workplace address. CSDs with the same degree of influence tend to be clustered. They form zones around CMAs and CAs that progress through the categories from 'strong' to 'no' influence as distance from the CMAs and CAs increases. As many CSDs in the territories are very large and sparsely populated, the commuting flow of the resident employed labour force is unstable. For this reason, CSDs in the territories that are outside CAs are assigned to a separate category that is not based on their commuting flows.

Note: The data on place of work are taken from the Census Program. Commuting, i.e., the journey to work, comprises four categories: at home; outside Canada; no fixed workplace address; and usual place of work. The calculation of the resident employed labour force excludes the category of no fixed workplace address for the 2016 Census.

CSDs outside CMAs and CAs are assigned to the following MIZ categories:
1.Strong metropolitan influenced zone: This category includes CSDs in provinces where at least 30% of the CSD's resident employed labour force (excluding the category of no fixed workplace address) commutes to work in any CMA or CA. It excludes CSDs with fewer than 40 persons in their resident employed labour force from the previous census.
2.Moderate metropolitan influenced zone: This category includes CSDs in provinces where at least 5% but less than 30% of the CSD's resident employed labour force (excluding the category of no fixed workplace address) commute to work in any CMA or CA. It excludes CSDs with fewer than 40 persons in their resident employed labour force from the previous census.
3.Weak metropolitan influenced zone: This category includes CSDs in provinces where more than 0% but less than 5% of the CSD's resident employed labour force (excluding the category of no fixed workplace address) commute to work in any CMA or CA. It excludes CSDs with fewer than 40 persons in their resident employed labour force from the previous census.
4.No metropolitan influenced zone: This category includes CSDs in provinces where none of the CSD's resident employed labour force (excluding the category of no fixed workplace address) commute to work in any CMA or CA. It also includes CSDs in provinces with fewer than 40 persons in their resident employed labour force from the previous census.
5.Territories (outside CAs): This category includes CSDs in the territories outside CAs.


Land area  
Number of square kilometres of land in a given geographic area (e.g., a province, a territory, a city). Land area data are unofficial and are provided for the sole purpose of calculating population density.


Statistical Area Classification (SAC)  
The Statistical Area Classification (SAC) groups census subdivisions (CSD) according to whether they are a component of a census metropolitan area (CMA), a census agglomeration (CA) or a census metropolitan influenced zone (MIZ). The MIZ categorizes all CSDs in provinces and territories that are outside CMAs and CAs. CSDs within provinces that are outside CMAs and CAs are assigned to one of four categories according to the degree of influence (strong, moderate, weak or no influence) that the CMAs or CAs have on them. CSDs within the territories that are outside CAs are assigned to a separate category.

The SAC is a variant of the Standard Geographical Classification (SGC). CSDs form the lowest level of the classification variant. The next level consists of CMAs, CAs and MIZs including the territories. The highest level consists of two categories that cover all of the land mass of Canada:
•inside census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations
•outside census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations.

The SAC provides unique numeric identification (codes) for these hierarchically-related geographic areas. It was established for the purpose of reporting statistics.


Census agglomeration (CA)  
See the definition of census metropolitan area (CMA) and census agglomeration (CA). 


Census division (CD)  
Group of neighbouring municipalities joined together for the purposes of regional planning and managing common services (such as police or ambulance services). These groupings are established under laws in effect in certain provinces of Canada. Census division (CD) is the general term for provincially legislated areas (such as county, municipalité régionale de comté and regional district) or their equivalents. In other provinces and the territories where laws do not provide for such areas, Statistics Canada defines equivalent areas for statistical reporting purposes in cooperation with these provinces and territories. Census divisions are intermediate geographic areas between the province/territory level and the municipality (census subdivision).

Census metropolitan area (CMA) and census agglomeration (CA) 
A census metropolitan area (CMA) or a census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre (known as the core). A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 of which 50,000 or more must live in the core based on adjusted data from the previous Census of Population Program. A CA must have a core population of at least 10,000 also based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. To be included in the CMA or CA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from data on place of work from the previous Census Program.

If the population of the core of a CA falls below 10,000, the CA is retired from the next census. However, once an area becomes a CMA, it is retained as a CMA even if its total population declines below 100,000 or the population of its core falls below 50,000. All areas inside the CMA or CA that are not population centres are rural areas.

When a CA has a core of at least 50,000, based on data from the previous Census of Population, it is subdivided into census tracts. Census tracts are maintained for the CA even if the population of the core subsequently falls below 50,000. All CMAs are subdivided into census tracts.


Census subdivision (CSD)  
Census subdivision (CSD) is the general term for municipalities (as determined by provincial/territorial legislation) or areas treated as municipal equivalents for statistical purposes (e.g., Indian reserves, Indian settlements and unorganized territories). Municipal status is defined by laws in effect in each province and territory in Canada.


Census tract (CT)  
Census tracts (CTs) are small, relatively stable geographic areas that usually have a population of less than 10,000 persons, based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. They are located in census metropolitan areas and in census agglomerations that had a core population of 50,000 or more in the previous census.

A committee of local specialists (for example, planners, health and social workers, and educators) initially delineates census tracts in conjunction with Statistics Canada. Once a census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) has been subdivided into census tracts, the census tracts are maintained even if the core population subsequently declines below 50,000.


Designated place (DPL)
Usually a small community that does not meet the criteria used to define municipalities or population centres (areas with a population of at least 1,000 and a density of 400 persons per square kilometre). Designated places are created by provinces and territories, in cooperation with Statistics Canada, to provide data for submunicipal areas.

Dissemination area (DA)
A dissemination area (DA) is a small, relatively stable geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks with an average population of 400 to 700 persons based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. It is the smallest standard geographic area for which all census data are disseminated. DAs cover all the territory of Canada.

Federal electoral district (FED) 
A federal electoral district (FED) is an area represented by a member of the House of Commons. The federal electoral district boundaries used for the 2016 Census are based on the 2013 Representation Order.

Province or territory
'Province' and 'territory' refer to the major political units of Canada. From a statistical point of view, province and territory are basic areas for which data are tabulated. Canada is divided into 10 provinces and 3 territories.

Rural area (RA) 
Rural areas (RAs) include all territory lying outside population centres (POPCTRs). Taken together, population centres and rural areas cover all of Canada.

Rural population includes all population living in rural areas of census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs), as well as population living in rural areas outside CMAs and CAs.


Postal code [OM]   
The postal codeOM is a six-character code defined and maintained by Canada Post Corporation for the purpose of sorting and delivering mail.


Core, fringe and rural area 
The terms 'core,' 'fringe' and 'rural area' distinguish between population centres (POPCTR) and rural areas (RA) within a census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA).

A CMA or CA can have two types of cores: the core and the secondary core. The core is the population centre (POPCTR) with the highest population, around which a CMA or a CA is delineated. The boundaries and population counts of the population centres (core) used to delineate the CMAs or CAs are taken from the previous census. The core must have a population of at least 50,000 persons in the case of a CMA, or at least 10,000 persons in the case of a CA.

The secondary core is a population centre with at least 10,000 persons (based on the previous census) and that is within a CMA or CA, but outside the main municipality (census subdivision) that contains the core. The secondary core can also be the core of a CA that has been merged with an adjacent CMA.

The term 'fringe' is applied to all population centres (POPCTRs) within a CMA or CA that have less than 10,000 persons (based on the previous census) that are not contiguous to a core or a secondary core. In some circumstances (POPCTRs) that have 10,000 or more persons (based on the previous census) are designated 'fringe'. These are POPCTRs that exist inside census subdivisions (CSD) that are already contiguous with a core or a secondary core. All territory within a CMA or CA that is not classified as a core or fringe is classified as 'rural area'.


Population centre (POPCTR)  
A population centre (POPCTR) has a population of at least 1,000 and a population density of 400 persons or more per square kilometre, based on population counts from the current Census of Population. All areas outside population centres are classified as rural areas.

Taken together, population centres and rural areas cover all of Canada.

Population centres are classified into three groups, depending on the size of their population:
•small population centres, with a population between 1,000 and 29,999
•medium population centres, with a population between 30,000 and 99,999
•large urban population centres, with a population of 100,000 or more.

Population centre population includes all population living in the cores, secondary cores and fringes of census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs), as well as the population living in population centres outside CMAs and CAs.


Economic region (ER) 
An economic region (ER) is a grouping of complete census divisions (CDs), with one exception in Ontario, created as a standard geographic unit for analysis of regional economic activity.

Economic family after-tax income decile group - The economic family income decile group provides a rough ranking of the economic situation of a person based on his or her relative position in the Canadian distribution of the adjusted after-tax income of economic families for all persons in private households.
 
Using data from the 2016 Census of Population, the population in private households is sorted according to its adjusted after-tax family income and then divided into 10 equal groups each containing 10% of the population. The decile cut-points are the levels of adjusted after-tax family income that define the 10 groups.
 
For the 2016 Census, the reference period is the calendar year 2015 for all income variables.

Footnote 56
Low-income status - The income situation of the statistical unit in relation to a specific low-income line in a reference year. Statistical units with income that is below the low-income line are considered to be in low income.
 
For the 2016 Census, the reference period is the calendar year 2015 for all income variables.
 
The low-income concepts are not applied in the territories and in certain areas based on census subdivision type (such as Indian reserves). The existence of substantial in-kind transfers (such as subsidized housing and First Nations band housing) and sizeable barter economies or consumption from own production (such as product from hunting, farming or fishing) could make the interpretation of low-income statistics more difficult in these situations.
 
Low-income measure, after tax (LIM-AT) - The Low-income measure, after tax, refers to a fixed percentage (50%) of median-adjusted after-tax income of private households. The household after-tax income is adjusted by an equivalence scale to take economies of scale into account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the fact that a household's needs increase, but at a decreasing rate, as the number of members increases.
 
Using data from the 2016 Census of Population, the line applicable to a household is defined as half the Canadian median of the adjusted household after-tax income multiplied by the square root of household size. The median is determined based on all persons in private households where low-income concepts are applicable. Thresholds for specific household sizes are presented in Table 4.2 Low-income measures thresholds (LIM-AT and LIM-BT) for private households of Canada, 2015, Dictionary, Census of Population, 2016.
 
When the unadjusted after-tax income of household pertaining to a person falls below the threshold applicable to the person based on household size, the person is considered to be in low income according to LIM-AT. Since the LIM-AT threshold and household income are unique within each household, low-income status based on LIM-AT can also be reported for households.
 
Low-income cut-offs, after tax (LICO-AT) - The Low-income cut-offs, after tax refers to an income threshold, defined using 1992 expenditure data, below which economic families or persons not in economic families would likely have devoted a larger share of their after-tax income than average to the necessities of food, shelter and clothing. More specifically, the thresholds represented income levels at which these families or persons were expected to spend 20 percentage points or more of their after-tax income than average on food, shelter and clothing. These thresholds have been adjusted to current dollars using the all-items Consumer Price Index (CPI).
 
The LICO-AT has 35 cut-offs varying by seven family sizes and five different sizes of area of residence to account for economies of scale and potential differences in cost of living in communities of different sizes. These thresholds are presented in Table 4.3 Low-income cut-offs, after tax (LICO-AT - 1992 base) for economic families and persons not in economic families, 2015, Dictionary, Census of Population, 2016.
 
When the after-tax income of an economic family member or a person not in an economic family falls below the threshold applicable to the person, the person is considered to be in low income according to LICO-AT. Since the LICO-AT threshold and family income are unique within each economic family, low-income status based on LICO-AT can also be reported for economic families.
 
Prevalence of low income - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified low-income line.

Tenure - Refers to whether the household owns or rents their private dwelling. The private dwelling may be situated on rented or leased land or be part of a condominium. A household is considered to own their dwelling if some member of the household owns the dwelling even if it is not fully paid for, for example if there is a mortgage or some other claim on it. A household is considered to rent their dwelling if no member of the household owns the dwelling. A household is considered to rent that dwelling even if the dwelling is provided without cash rent or at a reduced rent, or if the dwelling is part of a cooperative.
 
For historical and statutory reasons, shelter occupancy on Indian reserves or settlements does not lend itself to the usual classification by standard tenure categories. Therefore, a special category, band housing, has been created and is included in the classification of tenure.

Footnote 157
Condominium status - Refers to whether the private dwelling is part of a condominium development. A condominium is a residential complex in which dwellings are owned individually while land and common elements are held in joint ownership with others.

Footnote 158

Also included are rooms used as bedrooms now, even if they were not originally built as bedrooms, such as bedrooms in a finished basement. Bedrooms exclude rooms designed for another use during the day such as dining rooms and living rooms even if they may be used for sleeping purposes at night. By definition, one-room private dwellings such as bachelor or studio apartments have zero bedrooms.

Footnote 159
Rooms - Refers to enclosed areas within a private dwelling which are finished and suitable for year-round living. The number of rooms of a private dwelling includes kitchens, bedrooms and finished rooms in the attic or basement. The number of rooms of a private dwelling excludes bathrooms, halls, vestibules and rooms used solely for business purposes. Partially divided rooms are considered to be separate rooms if they are considered as such by the respondent (e.g., L-shaped dining-room and living-room arrangements).

Footnote 160
Persons per room - Refers to an indicator of the level of crowding in a private dwelling. It is calculated by dividing the number of persons in the household by the number of rooms in the dwelling.

Footnote 161
Housing suitability - Refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is, whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as calculated using the NOS.
 
Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies.

Footnote 162
Period of construction - Refers to the period in time during which the building or dwelling was originally constructed. This refers to the period in which the building was completed, not the time of any later remodelling, additions or conversions.

Footnote 163

A household maintainer is a person residing in the household who is responsible for paying the rent, or the mortgage, or the taxes, or the electricity or other services or utilities. Where a number of people may contribute to the payments, more than one person in the household may be identified as a household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making any such payments, the first person listed is selected by default.

Footnote 166
Primary household maintainer - The first person in the household identified as someone who pays the rent, or the mortgage, or the taxes, or the electricity or other services or utilities for the dwelling. When more than one member of the household contributes to the payments, the first person listed is chosen as the primary household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making any such payments, the first person listed is selected by default.
 
The order of the persons in a household is determined by the order in which they are listed on the questionnaire. Generally, an adult is listed first followed, if applicable, by their spouse or common-law partner and then by their children. The order does not necessarily correspond to the proportion of household payments made by each person.

Footnote 167
Shelter-cost-to-income ratio - Refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs. 
 
Shelter-cost-to-income ratio is calculated for private households living in owned or rented dwellings who reported a total household income greater than zero. 
Private households living in band housing, located on an agricultural operation that is operated by a member of the household, and households who reported a zero or negative total household income are excluded. 
  
The relatively high shelter costs to household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2016, while household total income is reported for the year 2015. As well, for some households, the 2015 household total income may represent income for only part of a year.

The relatively high shelter-costs-to-household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2016, while household total income is reported for the year 2015. As well, for some households, the 2015 household total income may represent income for only part of a year.

Highest certificate, diploma or degree is the classification used in the census to measure the broader concept of 'Educational attainment.'
 
This variable refers to the highest level of education that a person has successfully completed and is derived from the educational qualifications questions, which asked for all certificates, diplomas and degrees to be reported.  
 
The general hierarchy used in deriving this variable (high school, trades, college, university) is loosely tied to the 'in-class' duration of the various types of education. At the detailed level, someone who has completed one type of certificate, diploma or degree will not necessarily have completed the credentials listed below it in the hierarchy. For example, a person with an apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma may not have completed a high school certificate or diploma, nor does an individual with a 'master's degree' necessarily have a 'certificate or diploma above bachelor level.' Although the hierarchy may not fit all programs perfectly, it gives a general measure of educational attainment.
 
This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households.
 
Users are advised to consult data quality comments for 'Highest certificate, diploma or degree', available in the Education Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2016, Catalogue no. 98-500-X2016013.

This variable refers to the predominant discipline or area of learning or training of a person's highest completed postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree, classified according to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2016.  
 
This 'Major field of study' variable can be used either independently or in conjunction with the 'Highest certificate, diploma or degree' variable. When the latter is used with 'Major field of study,' it should be noted that different fields of study will be more common for different types of postsecondary qualifications. At the detailed program level, some programs are only offered by certain types of institutions.
 
There was an explicit instruction in the questionnaire which instructed respondents to be as specific as possible in indicating a subfield or subcategory of specialization within a broad discipline or area of training. 
 
This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households.
 
This variable shows the 'Variant of CIP 2016 - Alternative primary groupings' CIP variant, with the hierarchy of the primary groupings and two-digit series. When a primary grouping contains more than one subseries from series '30. Multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary studies,' these subseries are grouped together. An exception is made for '30.01 Biological and physical sciences' due to its large size. For more information on the CIP classification, see the Classification of Instructional Programs, Canada 2016: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/classification.

At the detailed program level, some programs are only offered by certain types of institutions.
 
There was an explicit instruction in the questionnaire which instructed respondents to be as specific as possible in indicating a subfield or subcategory of specialization within a broad discipline or area of training. 
 
This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households.
 
This variable shows the 'Variant of CIP 2016 - Alternative primary groupings' CIP variant, with the hierarchy of the primary groupings and two-digit series. When a primary grouping contains more than one subseries from series '30. Multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary studies,' these subseries are grouped together. An exception is made for '30.01 Biological and physical sciences' due to its large size. For more information on the CIP classification, see the Classification of Instructional Programs, Canada 2016: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/classification. 
 
For information on collection, classification and data quality for this variable, refer to the Education Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2016, Catalogue no. 98-500-X2016013.
Certain series and their subcomponents are not used when coding major field of study for the census. These are series 21, 32 to 37 and 53, which represent non-credit and personal improvement fields of study.

In both cases, location of study refers to the location of the institution granting the certificate, diploma or degree, not the location of the person at the time he or she obtained the qualification or was attending the institution. The geographic location is specified according to boundaries current at the time the data are collected, not the boundaries at the time of study.
 
This is a summary variable that indicates whether the 'Location of study' of the person's highest certificate, diploma or degree was the same province or territory where the person lived at the time of the 2016 Census of Population, a different Canadian province or territory, or outside Canada. This variable is derived from 'Location of study' and 'Province or territory of current residence.' It only applies to individuals who had completed a postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree.
 
'Location of study outside Canada' may be further sub-classified using the Standard Classification of Countries and Areas of Interest (SCCAI). When using the SCCAI for this sub-classification, the class 'Canada' is not used.

The census assumes that the commute to work originates from the usual place of residence, but this may not always be the case. Sometimes, respondents may be on a business trip and may have reported their place of work or main mode of commuting based on where they were working during the trip. Some persons maintain a residence close to work and commute to their home on weekends. Students often work after school at a location near their school.
