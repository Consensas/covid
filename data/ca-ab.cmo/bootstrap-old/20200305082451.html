<h2><a id="top" name="top"></a>Current situation</h2>

<p>A pneumonia outbreak, now known to be caused by COVID-19,&nbsp;was identified in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO)&nbsp;has declared the outbreak of the virus a public health emergency.</p>

<p>There are no confirmed or probable cases in Alberta.&nbsp;To date, 33 cases have been announced in Canada.</p>

<p>The current overall risk to Albertans is considered low by medical experts.</p>

<h2>About coronavirus</h2>

<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause respiratory illness in people, ranging from mild common colds to severe illnesses. Others cause illness in animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people then spread from person to person through close contact.</p>

<p>Novel coronaviruses are new strains of the virus that have not been previously identified in humans.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 strain&nbsp;does not appear to be as severe as other coronaviruses, such as SARS. Many patients have reported only mild symptoms.</p>

<h2>How it's transmitted</h2>

<p>At this time, it appears COVID-19 is transmitted through person-to-person spread by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>larger droplets, like from a cough or sneeze</li>
	<li>touching contaminated objects or surfaces, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth</li>
</ul>

<p>While there is person-to-person spread, current evidence indicates it is not airborne through long distances or times. There is no evidence that it's capable of being transmitted by imported goods.</p>

<h2>Current risk level in Alberta</h2>

<p>The current risk level is low.</p>

<p>Risk is determined&nbsp;by assessing how likely Albertans are to be exposed to the virus in the province. Currently, Albertans have a very low chance of contracting COVID-19. If this changes, the risk level in Alberta will be updated accordingly.</p>

<h2>Actions being taken</h2>

<p>Alberta’s public health officials are carefully monitoring the situation in Canada, China and around the world, and are ready to respond should there be any cases in Alberta. They are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>working closely with federal, provincial and territorial partners to share information and assess potential health risks</li>
	<li>ensuring our health system is ready to respond effectively if needed</li>
	<li>ensuring front-line health professionals have information about the virus so they can:
	<ul>
		<li>take recommended actions</li>
		<li>promptly report suspected cases to public health officials</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>expanding testing protocols to include travellers returning from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Iran, South Korea, Japan and Italy</li>
	<li>updating self-isolation and self-monitoring recommendations for travellers returning from affected countries, as required</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cases and testing</h2>

<h3>Cases in Alberta and Canada</h3>

<p>There are no confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19&nbsp;in Alberta at this time. The cases in&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;have been&nbsp;travel-related and have been isolated to prevent further transmission.</p>

                    <p>As a precautionary measure, people returning from outside Canada should follow these steps.</p>

<h3>Returning from Iran or Hubei Province, China</h3>

<p>If you have returned from Iran or Hubei province, China, we recommend that you isolate yourself until 14 days have passed since that visit. We recommend this even if you are feeling well. This is a precautionary move only.</p>

<p>You can isolate yourself by following these <a href="https://open.alberta.ca/publications/self-isolation-information-sheet">self-isolation guidelines</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>avoid close contact with other people, especially those with chronic conditions, a compromised immune system, or seniors</li>
	<li>do not attend work, school, social events or any other public gatherings</li>
	<li>watch for symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing in yourself or a family member</li>
	<li>call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> if any symptoms begin</li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning from other parts of mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan. Singapore, South Korea or Italy</h3>

<p>If you returned from other parts of China, or Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea or Italy, we are not recommending self-isolation. However, you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>monitor yourself for symptoms like fever or cough daily for 14 days after you have left the affected area</li>
	<li>contact <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> for medical advice if you or a family member:
	<ul>
		<li>feel ill after returning</li>
		<li>were in contact with someone diagnosed with novel coronavirus</li>
		<li>were in a health-care facility in any of these countries</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Departing travellers</h3>

                    <p>Alberta public health officials are recommending the following actions as a precaution:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a student has visited Iran or China’s Hubei province in the last 14 days, it is recommended that they self-isolate until two weeks have passed since that visit. This is recommended even if they are feeling well.</li>
	<li>If a student has travelled to mainland China outside of Hubei province, or Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea or Italy&nbsp;in the last 14 days and they are feeling well, self-isolation is not recommended at this time. However, if the student has symptoms such as cough or fever, their parents are advised to keep the child home and call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a>.</li>
	<li>If a student has travelled to mainland&nbsp;anywhere outside Canada&nbsp;in the last 14 days, and was in contact with someone who was suspected or confirmed to have the novel coronavirus or if they were in a health-care facility while travelling, their parents are advised to call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a>, even if the student is feeling well, to discuss additional precautions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a student does not meet the exposure criteria above, they do not need to stay away from school and they will likely not be tested for COVID-19 as they do not meet the testing criteria. Therefore, requesting that the student provide a physician’s note is not appropriate. For health-related questions or concerns, please call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link at 811</a>.</p>

                    <p>Although travel-related cases may be identified, the risk for Albertans is still considered low at this time. Public health measures are in place to quickly identify potential cases and prevent the infection from spreading.</p>

<p>Influenza and other common viruses remain the most likely cause of a&nbsp;respiratory infection. To protect yourself and others:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing</li>
	<li>cover coughs and sneezes</li>
	<li>avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li>
	<li>stay at home and away from others if you are feeling ill</li>
	<li>contact your primary health provider or <a href="https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> if you have questions or concerns about your health</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wearing medical masks</h3>

<p>Masks can be very important in certain situations. When sick, wearing a mask helps prevent us from passing illnesses on to other people. This is why we ask people who have a cough or respiratory symptoms to wear a mask and wash their hands when visiting an emergency department or clinic.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are sick, wearing a mask helps prevent passing the illness on to other people.</li>
	<li>If you are healthy, medical masks are not recommended as they don't provide full protection and can create a false sense of security.</li>
	<li>See <a href="https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/ipc/hi-ipc-emerging-issues-ncov.pdf" target="_blank">appropriate infection prevention and control precautions for health-care settings</a>.</li>

                    <p>Symptoms for the novel coronavirus are similar to those for influenza or other respiratory illnesses. The most common symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>fever</li>
	<li>cough</li>
	<li>tiredness</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people (about 80%) recover from this disease without needing special treatment. Those who are older, and those with other medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness, which can include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>pneumonia</li>
</ul>

<p>Most cases have reported mild symptoms. However, there is a risk of death in severe cases.</p>

    <p>Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw issued the following statement for Albertans on&nbsp;March 4:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As cases of COVID-19 continue to be identified in Canada and around the world, I know many Albertans have questions. How concerned should I be? What can I do to prepare better?</p>

<p>"There are still no cases in Alberta, and the risk for Albertans remains low. However, we should continue to be mindful of the actions we can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of any respiratory infection, COVID-19 or otherwise.</p>

<p>“It’s important to stay home if you are sick and remind others to do the same until they no longer have symptoms. You should also be practicing frequent hand washing and making sure you’re covering your coughs and sneezes. Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, such as kitchen counters, children’s toys and door knobs, can also help limit your risk.</p>

<p>“Some of you may be asking if there is anything else you can do to prepare should COVID-19 arrive here in Alberta. While it’s important to have three days’ worth of essential items like food, water and medicine on hand in the event of any emergency, I want to caution against panic buying — the unnecessary purchasing of large quantities of supplies.</p>

<p>“Instead, I encourage you to plan ahead by examining your routines and what might need to change in the event COVID-19 arrives and you or a family member may need to self-isolate. For example, is there a friend or family member who would be available to help out with grocery shopping and other important errands? Do your grocery store and pharmacy offer delivery services? Are your prescriptions up to date?</p>

<p>“By having these conversations with your family, friends and neighbours, we can all be better prepared and ready to help those in need, without having to empty the shelves at Costco."</p>
