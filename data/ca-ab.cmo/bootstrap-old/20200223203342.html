<h2><a id="top" name="top"></a>Current situation</h2>

<p>A pneumonia outbreak, now known to be caused by a novel (new) coronavirus,&nbsp;was identified in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO)&nbsp;has declared the virus a public health emergency.</p>

<p>There are no confirmed or probable cases in Alberta. Nine confirmed or probable&nbsp;cases have been announced in Canada.</p>

<p>The current overall risk to Albertans is still considered low by medical experts.</p>

<h2>About coronavirus</h2>

<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause respiratory illness in people, ranging from mild common colds to severe illnesses. Others cause illness in animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people then spread from person to person through close contact.</p>

<p>Novel coronaviruses are new strains of the virus that have not been previously identified in humans.</p>

<p>The disease is caused by this strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) does not appear to be as severe as other coronaviruses, such as SARS. Many patients have reported only mild symptoms. There is person-to-person spread.</p>

<h2>Actions being taken</h2>

<p>Alberta’s public health officials are carefully monitoring the situation in Canada, China and around the world, and are ready to respond should there be any cases in Alberta. They are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>working closely with federal, provincial and territorial partners to share information and assess potential health risks</li>
	<li>ensuring our health system is ready to respond effectively if needed</li>
	<li>ensuring front-line health professionals have information about the virus so they can:
	<ul>
		<li>take recommended actions</li>
		<li>promptly report suspected cases to public health officials</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Albertans who’ve visited Hubei province, China, in the last 14 days are being asked to voluntarily isolate themselves until two weeks has passed since that visit. Find out more under the <a href="#p22780s6">info for Albertans section</a>.</p>

<h2>How it's transmitted</h2>

<p>At this time, it appears the virus is transmitted by larger droplets, like from a cough or sneeze. Current evidence indicates it is not airborne through long distances or times.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that it's capable of being transmitted by imported goods.</p>

<h2>Cases and testing</h2>

<h3>Cases in Alberta and Canada</h3>

<p>There are no confirmed or probable cases in Alberta at this time. The cases in&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;have been&nbsp;travel-related and have been isolated to prevent further transmission.</p>

                    <p>As a precautionary measure, people returning from mainland China should follow these steps.</p>

<h3>Returning from Hubei Province</h3>

<p>If you have returned from Hubei province, we recommend that you isolate yourself until 14 days have passed since that visit. We recommend this even if you are feeling well. This is a precautionary move only.</p>

<p>You can isolate yourself by following these <a href="https://open.alberta.ca/publications/self-isolation-information-sheet">self-isolation guidelines</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>avoid close contact with other people, especially those with chronic conditions, a compromised immune system, or seniors</li>
	<li>do not attend work, school, social events or any other public gatherings</li>
	<li>watch for symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing in yourself or a family member</li>
	<li>call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> if any symptoms begin</li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning from other parts of mainland China</h3>

<p>If you returned from mainland China outside of Hubei province, we are not recommending self-isolation. However, you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>monitor yourself for symptoms like fever or cough daily for 14 days after you have left mainland China</li>
	<li>contact <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> for medical advice if you or a family member:
	<ul>
		<li>feel ill after returning</li>
		<li>were in contact with someone diagnosed with novel coronavirus</li>
		<li>were in a health-care facility in mainland China</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Departing travellers</h3>

<p>If you are travelling to China or another affected country, consult the:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/210" target="_blank">Travel Health Notice for China</a> before leaving the country</li>

                    <p>Alberta public health officials are recommending the following actions as a precaution:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a student has visited China’s Hubei province in the last 14 days, it is recommended that they self-isolate until two weeks have passed since that visit. This is recommended even if they are feeling well.</li>
	<li>If a student has travelled to mainland China outside of Hubei province in the last 14 days and they are feeling well, self-isolation is not recommended at this time. However, if the student has symptoms such as cough or fever, their parents are advised to keep the child home and call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a>.</li>
	<li>If a student has travelled to mainland China outside of Hubei province in the last 14 days, and was in contact with someone who was suspected or confirmed to have the novel coronavirus or if they were in a health-care facility while travelling, their parents are advised to call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a>, even if the student is feeling well, to discuss additional precautions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a student does not meet the exposure criteria above, they do not need to stay away from school and they will likely not be tested for COVID-19 as they do not meet the testing criteria. Therefore, requesting that the student provide a physician’s note is not appropriate.

                    <p>Although travel-related cases may be identified, the risk for Albertans is still considered low. Public health measures are in place to quickly identify potential cases and prevent the infection from spreading.</p>

<p>Influenza and other common viruses remain the most likely cause of a&nbsp;respiratory infection. To protect yourself and others:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing</li>
	<li>cover coughs and sneezes</li>
	<li>avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li>
	<li>stay at home and away from others if you are feeling ill</li>
	<li>contact your primary health provider or <a href="https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> if you have questions or concerns about your health</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wearing medical masks</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Masks can be very important in certain situations. When sick, wearing a mask helps prevent us from passing illnesses on to other people. This is why we ask people who have a cough or respiratory symptoms to wear a mask and wash their hands when visiting an emergency department or clinic.</li>
	<li>If you are healthy, medical masks are not recommended as they don't provide full protection and can create a false sense of security.</li>

    <p>Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw issued the following statement for Albertans on&nbsp;February 21:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There are still no cases of the novel coronavirus in Alberta. There have been nine cases to date in Canada, and the risk of exposure remains low in Alberta.</p>

<p>“As we head into the third month since the novel coronavirus emerged, it's important to remember that global health challenges like this can take a while to resolve. We continue to monitor events across Canada and around the world. We continue to prepare in case the situation changes, and I can assure you that our health system is ready to respond if needed.</p>

<p>“There are actions you too can take to prepare in case the situation changes.</p>

<p>“First, I encourage you to stick to reliable sources for information about the coronavirus. Both Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services update their pages daily with information on the virus, as well as useful advice for returning travellers, schools, employers and healthcare workers.</p>

<p>“Second, although the current risk in Alberta is low, this could be an opportunity for businesses and employers to look at business continuity plans, using information from resources like the Respiratory Viruses and the Workplace bulletin linked on the Alberta Health coronavirus webpage under “employers”. Whether or not COVID-19 arrives in Alberta, using chances like this to review plans helps to prepare for any kind of disruption to usual business.</p>

<p>“Third, I encourage you to intentionally build good hygiene habits, which can help protect yourself and others around you against novel coronavirus and other respiratory illnesses, like influenza, which is currently in our communities. Wash your hands regularly, don’t touch your face with unwashed hands, cover your coughs and sneezes, and stay home when sick.</p>

<p>“Finally, I would ask that you don’t make assumptions about a person’s risk based on their ethnicity or country of origin, and by reminding others of this as well. We are stronger together.</p>

<p>"We continue to closely monitor the situation and will take all necessary steps to support your health.”</p>
