<h2>Current situation</h2>

<p>A pneumonia outbreak, now known to be caused by COVID-19,&nbsp;was identified in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO)&nbsp;has declared the outbreak of the virus a public health emergency.</p>

<p>There&nbsp;are&nbsp;4 presumptive or confirmed&nbsp;cases in Alberta and&nbsp;67 cases across&nbsp;Canada. The risk to Albertans is still low.</p>

<h2>About coronavirus</h2>

<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause respiratory illness in people, ranging from mild common colds to severe illnesses. Others cause illness in animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people then spread from person to person through close contact.</p>

<p>Novel coronaviruses are new strains of the virus that have not been previously identified in humans.</p>

<p>In some ways, COVID-19 is similar to influenza (also known as the flu):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Both COVID-19 and the flu cause respiratory disease in people who get sick.</li>
	<li>Both are spread the same way, via small droplets from the nose and mouth.</li>
	<li>Neither one is spread through the air over long distances and times, unlike a disease like the measles.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there are some key differences between COVID-19 and the flu:</p>

<ul>
	<li>COVID-19 does not appear to transmit as efficiently as influenza. Only those with symptoms seem to be mainly spreading the disease. This means that when people with symptoms are isolated, controlling spread is possible.</li>
	<li>We currently have no specific vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.</li>
	<li>COVID-19 causes severe disease in a higher percentage of cases than seasonal influenza. Estimates of mortality in COVID-19 cases depend on many things, but on average they range from about 1-2 deaths per 100 people infected. By comparison, seasonal influenza is deadly in about 1 in every 1000 who are infected.</li>
	<li>Because COVID-19 can cause such a serious illness, it is critical to keep it from spreading by having people with a cough or fever stay home and away from others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it's transmitted</h2>

<p>At this time, it appears COVID-19 is transmitted through person-to-person spread by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>larger droplets, like from a cough or sneeze</li>
	<li>touching contaminated objects or surfaces, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth</li>
</ul>

<p>Studies suggest that the virus generally only lasts a few hours on a surface, though it may be possible for it to last several days under ideal conditions.</p>

<p>While there is person-to-person spread, current evidence indicates it is not airborne through long distances or times. There is no evidence that it's capable of being transmitted by imported goods.</p>

<h2>Current risk level in Alberta</h2>

<p>The current risk level is low.</p>

<p>Risk is determined&nbsp;by assessing how likely Albertans are to be exposed to the virus in the province. Currently, Albertans have a very low chance of contracting COVID-19.</p>

<p>If this changes in the coming weeks, the risk level in Alberta will be updated accordingly.</p>

<h2>Actions being taken</h2>

<p>Alberta’s public health officials are carefully monitoring the situation in Canada, China and around the world, and are ready to respond. They are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>working closely with federal, provincial and territorial partners to share information and assess potential health risks</li>
	<li>ensuring our health system is ready to respond effectively if needed</li>
	<li>ensuring front-line health professionals have information about the virus so they can:
	<ul>
		<li>take recommended actions</li>
		<li>promptly report suspected cases to public health officials</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>updating self-isolation and self-monitoring recommendations for returning travellers experiencing symptoms, as required</li>
	<li>tracing all close contacts of presumptive and confirmed cases, testing and isolating those who are symptomatic, and asking even those who are well to self-isolate for 14 days after their last contact with the case</li>
</ul>

                    <p>As a precautionary measure, people returning from outside Canada should follow these steps.</p>

<h3>Monitor for symptoms</h3>

<h4>Returning from outside of Canada</h4>

<p>Anyone returning from outside of Canada, should follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>monitor yourself for symptoms such as cough or fever for 14 days</li>
	<li>self-isolate yourself and call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> for instructions on follow-up testing if you:
	<ul>
		<li>feel ill after returning and/or experience symptoms</li>
		<li>were in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19</li>
		<li>were in a health-care facility in an affected country</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Returning travellers should not visit emergency departments or urgent care centres for testing of COVID-19. Calling Health Link 811 is the best way to get quick assessment and testing, if needed.</p>

<h3>Self-isolate</h3>

<h4>Returning from Grand Princess Cruise, Iran or Hubei province, China</h4>

<p>If you have returned from the following locations, isolate yourself until 14 days have passed since that trip, even if you are feeling well:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Grand Princess cruise ship</li>
	<li>Iran</li>
	<li>Hubei province, China</li>
</ul>

<p>You can isolate yourself by following these <a href="/assets/documents/health-self-isolation-information-sheet.pdf">self-isolation guidelines</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>avoid close contact with other people, especially those with chronic conditions, a compromised immune system, or seniors</li>
	<li>do not attend work, school, social events or any other public gatherings</li>
	<li>watch for symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing in yourself or a family member</li>
	<li>call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> for instructions if any symptoms begin</li>
</ul>

<h3>Departing travellers</h3>

                    <p>Alberta public health officials are recommending the following actions as a precaution:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a student has visited a Grand Princess Cruise, Iran or China’s Hubei province in the last 14 days, it is recommended that they self-isolate until two weeks have passed since that visit. This is recommended even if they are feeling well.</li>
	<li>Parents should call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> for additional precautions and follow-up testing if their children have travellled to anywhere outside of Canada and experienced any of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>contact with someone who was suspected or confirmed to have the novel coronavirus</li>
		<li>were in a health-care facility</li>
		<li>have symptoms, such as cough or fever</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If a student does not meet the exposure criteria above, they do not need to stay away from school and they will likely not be tested for COVID-19 as they do not meet the testing criteria. Therefore, requesting that the student provide a physician’s note is not appropriate. For health-related questions or concerns, please call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link at 811</a>.</p>

                    <p>Alberta public health officials are recommending the following actions as a precaution:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If employees have visited a Grand Princess Cruise,&nbsp;Iran or China’s Hubei province in the last 14 days, it is recommended they isolate themselves until two weeks have passed since that visit. This is recommended even if they are feeling well.</li>
	<li>Employees should self-isolate and call <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a>&nbsp;for additional precautions and follow-up testing if they have travelled to anywhere outside of Canada and experienced any of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>contact with someone who was suspected or confirmed to have the novel coronavirus</li>
		<li>were in a health-care facility</li>
		<li>have symptoms, such as cough or fever</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If an employee does not meet the exposure criteria above, they do not need to stay away from work, and do not need any testing or a physician’s note to attend work.</p>

<p>If an employee is asked to self-isolate:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Employees and employers should work together to explore alternate working arrangements. This could include:
	<ul>
		<li>Working from home or remotely</li>
		<li>Doing work that does not require the employee to contact other people in the community or at work.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If an alternate working arrangement is not possible, employees can use paid sick time if their employer offers this.</li>
	<li>Employees may also be able to use five days of sick time without risk of losing their job with the personal and family responsibility leave, but this time is unpaid.</li>
	<li>Employers should consider their business continuity plans, and think about how the possibility of COVID-19 could impact their workplace. In order to prepare, we recommend plans are made to protect employees, limit spread in workplaces, and ensure continuity of critical services if staff are ill or self-isolating.</li>

                    <p>Alberta and other provinces are providing advice based on the best current evidence and guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

<p>Find information on general public health measures that may be recommended in communities if COVID-19 spreads in Canada can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/public-health-measures-mitigate-covid-19.html" target="_blank">Government of Canada website</a>.</p>

<p>If hosting an upcoming event or conference, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mass gatherings can contribute to the transmission of respiratory pathogens, such as COVID-19.</li>
	<li>Since mass gathering events are generally unique, the advice varies regarding which measures should be undertaken.</li>
	<li>Currently there are no formal restrictions on mass gatherings. Each community or event organizer should undertake a risk assessment to determine what makes sense for them.</li>
	<li>Decisions regarding mass gatherings can be considered on a continuum, including
	<ul>
		<li>no changes,</li>
		<li>enhanced communication to attendees,</li>
		<li>risk mitigation strategies being employed without cancelling the event (such as distancing measures and making hand hygiene supplies available),</li>
		<li>postponement or cancellation of the event.</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.ccohs.ca/publications/PDF/businesscontinuity.pdf" target="_blank">Business continuity planning</a> is vitally important to prepare critical operations for any potential interruption.</li>
	<li>Field officers from the Alberta Emergency Management Agency are available to support municipalities, First Nations and Metis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Settlements with their emergency management and business continuity planning.</p>

<p>To support the health system, communities should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Promote 811 as a source of information and to refer those with health-related concerns.</li>
	<li>Promote Alberta Labour’s “<a href="https://ohs-pubstore.labour.alberta.ca/bh022">Respiratory Viruses and the Workplace</a>” for workplace guidance.</li>
	<li>Review existing business continuity plans to assess if disruptions from staff absenteeism have been considered, especially for critical operations.</li>
	<li>Stay informed about the situation in Alberta via the Alberta Health Services or Alberta Health COVID-19 websites.</li>

                <div class="goa-text">
                    <p>For Albertans looking to prepare for COVID-19, Alberta public health officials are recommending the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a household plan of action. This can include these elements:
	<ul>
		<li>Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan.</li>
		<li>Meet with household members, other relatives, and friends to discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community and what the needs of each person will be.</li>
		<li>Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications. This includes practical steps like ensuring you have sufficient medication and determining what supplies are needed, and if they can be delivered.</li>
		<li>Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning.</li>
		<li>Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, health care services, support, and resources.</li>
		<li>Create an emergency contact list.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Practice good personal health habits and plan for home-based actions:
	<ul>
		<li>Practice everyday preventive actions, like those listed in the prevention section.</li>
		<li>Choose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy. Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible. Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Be prepared if your child’s school or childcare facility is temporarily dismissed</li>
	<li>Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
	<ul>
		<li>Learn about your employer’s emergency operations plan.</li>
		<li>Ask about what sick-leave policies and telework options are available if needed.</li>

                    <p>It’s important to remember that the risk for Albertans is still considered low at this time. Public health measures are in place to quickly identify potential COVID-19 cases and prevent the infection from spreading.</p>

<p>Influenza and other common viruses remain the most likely cause of a&nbsp;respiratory infection. To protect yourself and others:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing</li>
	<li>cover coughs and sneezes</li>
	<li>avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li>
	<li>stay at home and away from others if you are feeling ill</li>
	<li>contact your primary health provider or <a href="https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html" target="_blank">Health Link 811</a> if you have questions or concerns about your health</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wearing medical masks</h3>

<p>Masks can be very important in certain situations. When sick, wearing a mask helps prevent us from passing illnesses on to other people. This is why we ask people who have a cough or respiratory symptoms to wear a mask and wash their hands when visiting an emergency department or clinic.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are sick, wearing a mask helps prevent passing the illness on to other people.</li>
	<li>If you are healthy, medical masks are not recommended as they don't provide full protection and can create a false sense of security.</li>
	<li>See <a href="https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/ipc/hi-ipc-emerging-issues-ncov.pdf" target="_blank">appropriate infection prevention and control precautions for health-care settings</a>.</li>

                    <p><a id="p22780s8" name="p22780s8"></a>Symptoms for COVID-19 are similar to those for influenza or other respiratory illnesses. The most common symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>fever</li>
	<li>cough</li>
	<li>extreme tiredness</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people (about 80%) recover from this disease without needing special treatment.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;it can cause serious illness.&nbsp;Those who are older, and those with other medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness, which can include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>pneumonia</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a risk of death in severe cases.</p>

    <p>Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw issued the following statement for Albertans on&nbsp;March 9:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There have now been four presumptive or confirmed cases of COVID-19 detected in our province. We will promptly alert Albertans as any new cases are detected.</p>

<p>"I want to recognize the outstanding work of the health care professionals involved in the detection of COVID-19 cases to date, and the public health follow-up of each case. Our medical professionals’ quick action and expertise has helped detect cases of the virus and prevent its spread. I want to express my appreciation for the hard work that has gone into this response, both preparing for and acting on these cases.</p>

<p>"All the cases of COVID-19 to date are travel-related and recovering in isolation at home with support from public health officials. As soon as these cases were identified last night, we took immediate action to protect the public.</p>

<p>"Alberta has now announced four cases of COVID-19 in four days. For some, this news may be alarming. I want to underline that three of these four cases are linked to a single cruise ship.</p>

<p>"It is also important to know that, during yesterday alone, 299 tests were done for COVID-19 and 297 of those were negative.</p>

<p>"What these cases do tell us is that the approach Alberta is taking is the right one.</p>

<p>"At this point, the situation around the world is changing quickly, and all returning travelers from anywhere outside Canada need to be vigilant for illness, quickly isolate themselves if they experience symptoms, and call 811 for assessment and testing.</p>

<p>"While most people who catch this virus have a mild illness, it can be severe or even deadly for our elderly, and those with other medical conditions. In some cases, even otherwise healthy younger people can get very sick.</p>

<p>"For that reason, it is critical that all of us take seriously the recommendation to stay home when we feel ill with fever or cough.</p>

<p>"Unlike influenza, we do not have a vaccine or antiviral medicines to prevent the COVID-19 illness. Also, unlike influenza, none of us have any previous immunity.</p>

<p>"Thankfully, COVID-19 does not spread like measles. It does not travel through the air over long distances and times. However, it can spread person-to-person by larger droplets, like from a cough or sneeze, or by touching contaminated objects or surfaces, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>

<p>"So what does this mean for Albertans in the days to come?</p>

<p>“I want all Albertans to understand that our public health measures are doing precisely what they were intended to do: detect new cases and take immediate action. All infected individuals have been isolated and public health measures put in place to prevent the infection from spreading.</p>

<p>“Given global spread, it is likely that new cases will continue to be detected in our province. While the current risk of Albertans catching the virus remains low, this may change in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>“Albertans can prepare by continuing to practice good hygiene habits, such as washing their hands, covering their cough, and especially staying home while sick. If any Albertan has questions or health concerns, they should Health Link 811 for assessment and follow-up.</p>

<p>“We will continue taking whatever steps are necessary to minimize risk and keep Albertans safe.”</p>
